## Locally-sourced food for the community

Rootstock Northwest is a Washington-based non-profit that aims to
nourish our community by connecting people in need with fresh, locally
grown produce from nearby farms. We believe everyone deserves access
to healthy, high-quality food while supporting the small farmers who
sustain our regional food chain. By bridging farms and families, we
strengthen local food systems, reduce waste, and promote food equity.
