### Locally-sourced food for the community

At Rootstock Northwest, we believe that everyone deserves access to
fresh, local foods and the best way to achieve that aim is by
investing in small, local producers. In todayâ€™s world, our food is
increasingly coming from other communities, countries or even
continents. These lengthening supply chains make it increasingly
difficult to keep our local community fed because every link is
susceptible to disruptions and rising costs. Less than 50 years ago,
small local farmers supplied most of our food, making access to fresh,
high-quality food more reliable for everyone. Local producers are more
invested in the health and quality of the food that they grow because
they live in the communities that they feed. Fundamentally, this way
of feeding people creates a connection between the producers and
consumers that is missing today, meaning that both are more invested
in the success of the other. Thus, our goal at Rootstock Northwest is
to feed our communities directly from local producers. We are
passionate about feeding the needist among us, while ensuring that
every cent spent is also an investment in our local economy.
