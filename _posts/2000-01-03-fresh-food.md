# Fresh Food for the People

Our first program seeks to both fill the gap created by receding
funding for low income folks in King county by providing extra produce
and help local farmers also suffering from the same disappearing
funding by purchasing local food from the farmers and distributing it
among low income folks in our community.  We get double the power from
each dollar by serving low income folks, AND purchasing from
struggling small farms.
