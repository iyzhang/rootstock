# Fresh Food for the People

We deliver weekly bags of fresh local groceries, primarily produce, to
people in need, doubling the power of each dollar invested: fighting
food insecurity AND purchasing directly from small producers.

* Give a bag - Donate now to guarantee a weekly bag for a family in need. $40/week feeds one family.
* Get a bag - Want to get on the list to receive fresh local groceries? Fill out this simple application and we'll get back to you within a week about logistics and availability. Looking forward to feeding you.
