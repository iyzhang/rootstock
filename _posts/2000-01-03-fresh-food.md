# Fresh Food for the People

We deliver weekly bags of fresh local groceries, primarily produce, to
people in need, doubling the power of each dollar invested: fighting
food insecurity AND purchasing directly from small producers.

this simple application and we'll get back to you within a week about
logistics and availability. Looking forward to feeding you.
