### Amber Whittenberg, President

Hi, I'm Amber, I am a queer woman who grew up the oldest child of
teenage parents who were themselves fighting upstream against
generational poverty. I was the first woman in my family to graduate
high school and my sister and I were the first people in our family to
go to college. I spent my 20’s moving around, growing things when and
where I could while developing as an artist. My experiences watching
the intersections of race, class, gender and sexual identity collide
in the lives of my loved ones during this time were formative. In the
face of so much powerlessness and injustice, I became deeply invested
in studying the architecture of community resiliency and what it takes
to build stability and security in the midst of struggle.

I attended The Evergreen State College from 2010-2013 and studied Art,
Business and Sustainable Agriculture. I soaked up everything I could
about the local food system, sustainability, and closed loop
biological and economic systems. I attended conferences in my spare
time on Food Security and Socially Engaged Art. While still a student,
I began my first of 3 seasons experimenting with my own farming
practices. I found myself constantly daydreaming about community
networking and building a fully sustainable closed loop micro economy
that centers others who were also born swimming upstream. I met Damon
in 2016 and together we began to conceptualize what a closed loop
economic system that first does no harm then does a lot of good could
look like. Rootstock NW is the next iteration of supporting the local
food system and improving food security in our region and I am excited
to have the privilege of doing this work!

### Damon Grady

I am a lifelong Seattle resident and grew up on Capitol Hill.  I’ve
started numerous businesses over the past 20 years including Gimmee
Records, the Via Tribunali restaurants, Sure Can Access Point, and
Local Yokels.  Having accessible, affordable, clean, and natural foods
is something that’s very important to me.  Sustaining our local farms
through distributing their produce to communities in need is one of
the biggest ways we can assure that they are here for generations to
come.
