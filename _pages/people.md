### Amber Whittenberg, President

Amber grew up the oldest child of teenage parents navigating
generational poverty, an experience that sparked her lifelong
commitment to community resilience and social justice. She studied
Art, Business, and Sustainable Agriculture at The Evergreen State
College, where she immersed herself in local food systems,
sustainability, and socially engaged practices while experimenting
with her own small-scale farming. After partnering with Damon in 2016
to envision a closed-loop, harm-reducing economic model, she helped
shape what would become Rootstock NW, and is proud to continue working
to strengthen regional food security.

### Damon Grady

Damon is a lifelong Seattle resident and grew up on Capitol Hill.  He
has started numerous businesses over the past 20 years including
Gimmee Records, the Via Tribunali restaurants, Sure Can Access Point,
and Local Yokels.  Having accessible, affordable, clean, and natural
foods is something that’s very important to Damon.  Sustaining our local
farms through distributing their produce to communities in need is one
of the biggest ways we can assure that they are here for generations
to come.
